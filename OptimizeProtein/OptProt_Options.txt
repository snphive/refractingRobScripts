####ListPDBs you want analysed separated by comma's.
##All = All PDBs in de PDBs folder.
PDBs:Ab82b0sLigand.pdb;

####Program you want to run
##Stretchplot = Create plot representing the relative stability and total TANGO score or each APR
##Solubis = Do a gatekeeper scan over all APRs, mutate APR residues to gatekeeper residues
##SolubisMild = Do a full scan over all APRs, mutate APR residues to every other residue.
##SolubisDouble = Do a gatekeeper scan over all APRs, mutate APR residues to gatekeeper residues. Mutate every residue to every residue to find stabilizers for solubis mutant.
##Stabilize = Mutate every residue to every residue
##Supercharge = Try to recursively find mutations that increase the netcharge, without disturbing the complex and the stability
##CysScan = Scan for the possible introduction of Cys-Cys bridges in the protein
##DelPos = Delete Positive residues
##Indiv = provided individual list
##All = All the above.
Command:Solubis;

####In the case of a Supercharge command.
## P = try to increase the Netcharge to get the molecule positive
## N = try to decrease the Netcharge to get the molecule negative
## S = try to increase the charge it already has. If charge = 0 it won't do anything
