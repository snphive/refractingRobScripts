# refractingRobScripts
The intention here is to completely refactor the original Python scripts from non-object-oriented format to object-oriented. The original unchanged forms can be seen in the repository called 'originalScriptsAtJan2018'.


Btw, the repo name has a typo, it should ofcourse be 'refactoringRobScripts' :)
